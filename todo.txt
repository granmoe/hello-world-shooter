Fix bullets memory leak

OPTIMIZATIONS

Spin bullets or transform in some cool way
Paused game state, press any key to enter play mode, press p to pause
game begins paused (to get around enemy hitting player immediately)
Correct for enemy getting stuck on edges
Sound FX (shooting, hit by enemy, hit enemy, win, lose, beat all levels, music)
Look into whether game is running faster/slower at different times and how to normalize this
